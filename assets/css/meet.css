            <h1>Hello, I’m <span>Dr Janique</span></h1>
            <h2>Your dedicated <span>Chiropractor</span></h2>

            <p>
                I earned my Master’s Degree in Chiropractic from the University of Johannesburg, accredited by the European Council of Chiropractic.<br>
                Nearing the end of my studies, I actively sought a mentor to guide my professional and personal growth. I was referred to a well-regarded chiropractor in the northern suburbs, who taught me various techniques that greatly enriched my knowledge.<br>
                I am registered with the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) and am a member of the Chiropractic Association of South Africa (CASA) and Paediatric Chiropractic South Africa (PCSA).
